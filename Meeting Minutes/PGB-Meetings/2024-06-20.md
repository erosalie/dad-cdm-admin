    * Blue will need to: be ethically sound; be able to support playbooks for specific groups, needs and circumstances needs; reflect proactive, as well as reactive measures; map to Red where relevant; and be developed with a clear taxonomy of Actor Type, so that we can help orgs recognise themselves and others, and the roles that they and others can and do play
